# MTEC 3501 – Zoom Lesson Plan

## Transition: Speculation → Specificity → Research Infrastructure

**Mode:** Zoom (Snow Day)\
**Duration:** \~75 minutes

---

## Session Objectives

By the end of this class, students will:

- Define their project with structural specificity.
- Identify their "miracle step" (hidden assumption).
- Establish functional Zotero research infrastructure.
- Enter at least two research items (one connector, one manual).
- Apply structured tags aligned with research categories.

---

# 1. Opening Reframe (5 minutes)

State clearly:

> Brainstorming expands possibility.\
> Research stabilizes direction.\
> Today we make your idea specific enough that research can attach to it.

Clarify:

- You are not finalizing your project.
- You are making it research-ready.

---

# 2. “Make It Specific” Exercise (20 minutes)

## Step A – Working Title + Format (3 minutes)

Students must write:

- **Working Title** (no placeholders)
- **Project Format** (specific engine, platform, or medium)

Examples:

- 2D Unity Cooperative Game
- Interactive Audiovisual Installation (Projection + Spatial Audio)
- Modular 3D Printable Asset System
- AR Mobile Narrative Experience
- Unreal Engine VR Simulation

---

## Step B – User / Integrator Experience (7 minutes)

Students write a 5–7 sentence description using:

1. The user (or integrator) encounters…
2. They are able to…
3. The system responds by…
4. Over time…
5. The intended experience is…
6. This depends on…

Clarify:\
If developing assets, the "user" is the integrator (developer, designer, performer).

---

## Step C – System Description (7–10 minutes)

Students must describe explicitly:

- Platform / engine
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Core components
- Tools required
- Physical or digital infrastructure

Emphasize:

> The experience is the goal.\
> The system is the machinery that produces it.

---

# 3. The “Miracle Step” Reflection (10 minutes)

After 2–3 volunteers share:

Show the “Then a miracle occurs” cartoon.

Ask students to identify:

- Where something unexplained happens
- Where complexity suddenly appears
- What assumption is doing hidden work

Explain:

> That gap is where research belongs.

These often become:

- Technical research targets
- Precedent research questions
- GitHub issues
- Feasibility risks

---

# 4. Zotero Activation & Infrastructure (20 minutes)

## Objective

By the end of this segment, every student must:

- Be connected to the MTEC 3501 group library
- Have created a project subcollection
- Have entered at least two sources
- Have applied tags

---

## Folder Structure

Inside the MTEC 3501 Group Library:

```
MTEC 3501
  └── [StudentName_ProjectTitle]
```

Optional internal subfolders:

- Inspirational
- Precedent
- Technical
- Theoretical
- User

Keep structure minimal.

---

## Step 1 – Connector Entry (Live)

Students:

- Open a relevant website (project page, article, documentation)
- Use the Zotero browser connector
- Save to their project subcollection
- Add a 2–3 sentence note explaining relevance

No passive saving allowed.

---

## Step 2 – Manual Entry (Live)

Students:

- Create a manual item (Artwork, Game, Software, Book, etc.)
- Fill in fields properly
- Add creator, year, URL (if applicable)
- Add a note explaining relevance

This ensures structured metadata literacy.

---

# 5. Tag System Introduction (5–10 minutes)

Explain simply:

> Tags are how future-you searches past-you.

Require each student to apply:

- One research-type tag
- One function tag

---

## Core Research-Type Tags

- inspirational
- precedent
- technical
- theoretical
- user-research

---

## Function Tags (Examples)

- experience-design
- system-architecture
- interaction-model
- visual-style
- audio-design
- fabrication
- ai-integration
- game-mechanics
- narrative-structure
- ux

---

## Risk Tags (Optional but Encouraged)

- miracle-step
- feasibility-risk
- technical-unknown
- scope-risk

---

# 6. Tie to March 17 Adjudication (5–10 minutes)

Explain that for the March 17 juried presentation, students must provide:

- Annotated Research Bibliography (stored in Zotero, linked in GitHub)
- Clear project definition
- Prototype plan
- Milestones & GitHub issues

Zotero organization today makes adjudication preparation manageable.

If Zotero is not structured now, bibliography generation becomes chaotic later.

---

# 7. Closing Expectations

Before next class:

- Finalize Title + Format + Experience + System description
- Identify miracle step
- Add at least 2–3 inspirational research entries with notes
- Continue brainstorming (collection phase)

---

# Structural Arc of This Session

Today: Specificity → Mechanism → Assumption → Research Infrastructure

Next Class: Precedent + Technical Research Deepening → GitHub Structuring → Prototype Compression

Midsemester: Clarity + Feasibility + Research Engagement + Planning Maturity
