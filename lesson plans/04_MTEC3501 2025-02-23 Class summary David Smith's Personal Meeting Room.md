## Summary

### Project Specification and Presentation Preparation

David led a class session focused on project specification and preparation for an upcoming presentation on March 17th. He introduced a template for students to detail their projects, emphasizing the need for specificity in format, technology, and user experience. David provided examples and guided students through the process of completing the template, encouraging them to remove any vague or placeholder content. He also mentioned the importance of considering both the development and presentation systems required for their projects.
### Project Proposal Development Class

David led a class discussion on project proposal development, emphasizing the need for specificity and clear presentation of ideas. He introduced an assignment due in three weeks, on March 17th, where students must be able to describe their projects, including effort required, to present to an adjudicating panel. David explained the importance of project titles, formats, and user experiences, and encouraged students to think about how their assets would be used by others. He also introduced the concept of Zotero for research purposes and mentioned that he would share his screen to go through a presentation on the different areas students should focus on for their projects.
### Student Game Project Development Review

The meeting introduced several student projects, including August Snyder's Enigma Machine Recreation, Gabriel Aguilar's Life Frame by Frame multimedia art performance, Emerson Tanacella's Action Spirit 2D platformer game, Keenan Nesso's Hybrid Control drum pad, Ricardi Ricci's Timekeeper game assets, and Jose's Mizukata platformer game. David guided the group through a discussion on identifying design challenges and miracle points in their projects, emphasizing the importance of anticipating potential issues early in the development process to create cleaner solutions. The team was encouraged to think about unknowns in both system and content aspects of their projects, with David highlighting the need to differentiate between technical and narrative uncertainties.
### Project Updates and Technical Discussions

August discussed switching from Fusion 360 to Inventor to better integrate with GitHub, acknowledging the need to relearn some processes. Gabriel highlighted the challenge of finding the right space and budget for a performance project, with David suggesting they discuss this further after his teaching commitment in Vienna. Anderson focused on implementing two combat styles in a 2D game, with David advising to think big and plan for future iterations. Kenan's goal was to achieve low latency in an audio system, with David providing technical insights on latency, jitter, and the importance of unit testing.
### 3D Modeling and Multiverse Concepts

Ricardi discussed his debate about changing the way he textures 3D models, considering using Substance Painter or working within Blender. David advised learning multiple applications, emphasizing the value of bridging between different tools for versatility and adaptability. Jose explored the relationship between two modes in his project, inspired by games like Food Plastas and ARGs, where a main game exists alongside alternate modes without affecting the main game. David clarified the concept of a multiverse with defined rules and encouraged Jose to identify gaps in his project as both technical challenges and narrative elements. The conversation ended with an introduction to Zotero, a tool for managing research, and instructions for setting up Zotero accounts and collections for the class.
### Zotero Setup and Usage Tutorial

David guided the team through the process of setting up and using Zotero, a collaborative research tool. He explained how to create an account, download the app, and sync it with the EmTech 3501 collection. David demonstrated how to use the Zotero connector from a browser to add references to the shared library. He also showed how to create sub-collections within the main library. The team discussed some initial challenges with syncing and using the app, but by the end of the session, most members had successfully accessed the shared collection.
### Zotero Research Management Demonstration

David demonstrated how to use Zotero for managing research sources and inspired the class to upload their inspirational sources into a dedicated folder in the EmTech 3501 collection. He explained that the next step is to upload research materials into Zotero, with a focus on organizing, citing, indexing, and building reports. David also outlined the requirements for the March 17 presentation, which includes a 10-minute project pitch, a 5-minute response, and a written response from the adjudicator, emphasizing the importance of refining the project throughout the semester.
### Project Presentation Structure and Requirements

David outlined the structure and requirements for a project presentation and deliverables, emphasizing the importance of a clear one-sentence summary and a well-defined project scope. He discussed the need for a written proposal in GitHub, which will include a speculative proposal for the prototype and a vague outline of the project's progression. David also highlighted the importance of articulating the project's large-scale vision and framing it within a broader context, while also preparing for potential questions and feedback from industry experts during the presentation.
### Project Management and Timeline Discussion

David discussed the project breakdown and emphasized the importance of identifying ambiguities and unknowns to address challenges. He outlined a project timeline, including research, speculation, and presentation phases, and introduced the use of GitHub for project management. David also explained the need for a prototype plan and the importance of demonstrating capabilities within identified systems. He encouraged students to use GitHub branches for their work and to merge with the main branch before the presentation deadline.
### Zotero Integration and Project Planning

The team discussed the use of Zotero for managing project-related documents and research materials. David explained that any relevant information, including images, academic papers, and other resources, should be uploaded to Zotero, with a focus on organizing important items later. Jose faced issues syncing Zotero on Windows, which David helped resolve by providing guidance on accessing and linking the account. David emphasized the importance of populating Zotero with research findings and encouraged the team to continue adding materials. He also mentioned that over the next week, the project should be made more specific, and milestone tracking would be set up to ensure everyone is up to date on GitHub.
### Zotero and GitHub Setup Tutorial

David helped Kenan set up Zotero and access the GitHub repository. They successfully added Max 8 documentation to Zotero and fixed an issue with Kenan's GitHub access. David instructed Kenan to populate Zotero with research materials and to work on the Keenan branch in GitHub before pushing to the main branch.
### Zotero Troubleshooting and Presentation Advice

David helped Anderson troubleshoot issues with Zotero, a research management tool, and demonstrated how to add files and attachments. They discovered that Anderson was unable to upload files despite having sufficient storage space, and David suggested checking Zotero's settings. They also discussed Anderson's project presentation, with David advising that for the upcoming 3-week presentation, a simple demonstration or video screenshot would be sufficient, while for the final presentation, showing basic Unity capabilities like character movement would be appropriate. David emphasized that the current focus should be on design and research rather than building complex features.
