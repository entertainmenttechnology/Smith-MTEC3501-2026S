# MTEC 3501 — Semester Scaffold (S–R–D–M–P-A Cycle[^1], 15 Weeks)

| Week | Topic / Focus | Proof of Concept Project | Technical Tools, Competencies | GitHub | Zotero | AI / Integration | Resource |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Speculate \- Ideate,**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **1** | **Course overview, Introduction** Cold Open First writing : what is your idea?  Goals Design Culmination Project Learn Professional Tools & Practices Collaborate Effectively Communicate Across Modalities  Develop Situational Awareness  Class Philosophy Think Boldly\! Push envelopes contextualize ideas within the larger environment Iterative R\&D Engineering development example Slow awkward expensive unreliable rare to  fast elegant inexpensive robust ubiquitous Six Stages Project Development **SRDPMA**)  This too is iterative, as assessment leads to speculation Also fractal. Note this is a model of process, not the process itself. Introduction to Communication Tools  Combinative Reality Medium is NOT the Message:  Systems vs Symbols Engineering vs Design Balanced Blended Space,  Collaborative AI Mediation Pathways Holistic Integration:  Philosophical Approach Practical opportunities for teams speculative ideation  Second Writing.  The great “What if”? inspirations  | Speculative first concept The Aspirational Climax version: Unlimited budget, time, etc. Dream Big\! Dream Crazy\! What I hope to show at the end of the second semester (Functioning Prototype)  | Ideation and framing questions:  What do I think I need?  What do I think I know?  What do I think I don’t know? | Sign up for GitHub account GitHub Browser orientation;  Install  GitHub Desktop Visual Studio Code;  ensure repository access next week | Sign up for Zotero account | Identification of student current practice or familiarity with AI tools. Which students aim to involve AI directly in their project, and if so, how and where? Fill out AI use form |  |
| **2** | Speculation and Brainstorming. Types of brainstorming techniques Personal project management setup  Github, Zotero, Discord | Brainstorming Sessions,  assessment feedback,  integration | Identify potential production tools/techniques, delivery platforms, media.   What competencies already exist, what need to be learned/improved? | Branch from main;  create project folder README.md Upload Brainstorm Documentation | Join Class Shared Zotero Org. Install connector;  Review existing Zotero bibliography  | AI brainstorming for idea framing |  |
| **Research \- Background, prior Art, need,**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **3** | Precedent research  Precedent Technology Documentation and Citation Vision and Project Scope:  Proof of Concept (PoC) Functioning Prototype (LVP?) Aspirational Climax   project scoping Citation Documentation \- Zotero BBS Introduction \- Lecture part 1a | Detailed Speculative Proposal (pre-research)   | Research methods;  What prior art? What technology is needed? | Using GitHub Desktop Refine [README.md](http://README.md) for project Markdown Proposal uploaded to GitHub  | add first source, tags Add sources & notes; annotate Reference comparable case studies | AI for summarizing precedent sources AI for converting text to markdown |  |
| **4** | Research synthesis → design intent.   What is the intent?  What are the existing Gaps? What problem is this designed to address? why is it different? | Research synthesis with speculative proposal | Analytical synthesis;  mapping constraints based on approach/platform | **Project Board** created with  Research Issues | Cite with Zotero in Markdown | AI-assisted synthesis draft |  |
| **Design \- Speculative and Design Documentation** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **5** | Blended Space Mediation pathways;  draft design & diagrams  select initial toolchain | Draft **Design Document** (Markdown \+ diagrams) | Diagramming; tool/tech selection and feasibility | Issues refined; Project Board scoped | Zotero citations in design doc | AI diagramming / visualization tools |  |
| **6** | Define PoC scope & feasibility;  plan skill acquisition | Updated Design Doc; list of competencies/technologies; PoC plan outline | Initial experiments with chosen tools skill  acquisition of identified  tools | Board refined | Zotero references for feasibility | AI skill tutorials / competency mapping |  |
| **7** | Prototype strategy;  Project Management Timeline: small trials / test beds | Detailed Design Documentation for PoC Description Milestones/Timeline  | Hands-on trials with tools (software/hardware/fabrication) Access to tool demonstrated | Create prototype branch;  link tests to Issues Timeline for PoC deliverable. | Document prototypes with references | AI experiment logs / test evaluation |  |
| **Internal Presentation**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **8** | Proposal Presentations | **Prototype v0** committed Start drafting PoC documentation | Demonstrate access to required tools to realize PoC | Prototype branch merged as appropriate | Cite methods, instruction manuals/resources  | AI-assisted code/debugging support |  |
| **Make / Produce \- Iterative cycle and Proof of Concept**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **9** | Prototype Iteration 2; gather structured feedback | Revised prototype;   | Iterative making | Open PRs for docs;  review comments | Archive sources supporting iteration | AI critique / peer review augment |  |
| **10** | Prototype Iteration 3:; expand on prototype | expanded functionality | Integration of multiple tools/components | Repo updates;  doc draft started |  | AI for integration troubleshooting |  |
| **11** | Prototype Iteration 4:  | Updated design sections;  refined prototype | Iteration planning; update tool decisions | Branch/notes committed;  board updated | Updated Zotero annotations | AI design refinements, alternatives |  |
| **12** | Assemble PoC proposal package; build slide deck. | **Draft PoC package** slide deck (timed) | Presentation structuring; documentation standards | Repo organization pass | Verify citations in docs/slides | AI slide/delivery rehearsal |  |
| **13** | **Dress rehearsal**: timed 10‑minute run‑through with critique | Revised deck & run-of-show;  final checklist | Timeboxing; run-of-show;  Q\&A handling | Repo near‑final; README polished | Final Zotero check | AI for timing/Q\&A simulation |  |
| **Publish \- Finale Presentations and Proof of Concept Demonstration** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **14** | **Juried presentations** (Group A) — strict **10 minutes** \+ Q\&A; repo freeze 24h prior | Group A: juried presentation submitted | Demonstrate competencies via live demo/presentation | Final repo submitted | Zotero archive packaged | AI optional demo companion |  |
| **Assess** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **15** | **Juried presentations** (Group B); **final assessment** & self‑evaluation | Group B: juried presentation;  **Final deliverables**:  self‑assessment | Reflection & evidence‑driven assessment | Final repo submission | Zotero archive complete and bibliography with correct citations published in documentation | AI-assisted reflective writing |  |

**Notes** \- Juried presentations split across Weeks 14–15 depending on class size; all are strictly **10 minutes** (plus Q\&A).  
\- Assessment is the final step of the macro cycle, closing the semester with reflection and evaluation.
