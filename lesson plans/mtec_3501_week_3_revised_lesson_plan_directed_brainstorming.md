# Week 3 – Lesson Plan (Revised)

**Course:** MTEC 3501 – Culmination Project Development\
**Format:** Zoom (Full Class)\
**Duration:** 2.5 hours (150 minutes)\
**Theme:** From Speculation to Structure – Directed Brainstorming, Project Scoping, and Research Setup

---

## ✅ Learning Goals

By the end of this session, students will:

- Upload and integrate prior brainstorming materials into the shared GitHub workflow
- Practice multiple **directed brainstorming techniques** as structured tools
- Experience how different ideation methods surface different kinds of insight
- Clarify early project scope (PoC → LVP → Aspirational)
- Begin organizing inspirational precedent research
- Understand expectations leading toward the Week 7 proposal milestone

---

## 🕒 Class Agenda (150 Minutes)

### 🟢 Part 1 – GitHub Web Recap, Assignment Alignment, and Discussion Setup (20 min)

This step is aligned explicitly with **Assignment 2: Speculative Brainstorming Expansion** .

- Verify each student’s project folder exists in their branch

- Clarify that **this assignment involves two distinct artifacts**, serving different purposes:

  **A. GitHub Discussion Post (Required Today)**

  - Each student creates a **top-level post** in the GitHub Discussions board
  - Title format:
    ```
    [Your Name] – Brainstorming for [Project Title]
    ```
  - Content:
    - 2–5 sentence *Project Snapshot*
    - What the idea currently is
    - Why it interests you
  - This post becomes the **hub** for peer brainstorming during class and asynchronously

  **B. Personal Working Brainstorming Document (Not Uploaded Yet)**

  - Each student maintains a private working document titled: `Brainstorming_1_[YourName]`
  - This document may be Markdown, Google Docs, handwritten notes, etc.
  - It is used to apply *all brainstorming techniques* to their own project
  - This document will be uploaded later, after expansion is complete

- Emphasize: **Do not upload the working brainstorming document yet**

- Instructor confirms that *all students have posted* to Discussions before proceeding

---

### 🔵 Part 2 – Directed Brainstorming Roundtable (40 min)

This replaces the earlier **guided questions** format.

**Purpose:**

- Practice multiple brainstorming techniques as explicit tools
- Allow students to experience how different methods produce different insights
- Build shared literacy around ideation strategies

**Primary reference document:**

- *Brainstorming Techniques: A Practical Guide* (used live in class)

**Structure:**

- One student becomes the focus at a time
- One brainstorming technique is applied per student
- The class participates collectively
- The focused student listens and takes notes only
- No defending, narrowing, or solving during the exercise

> Instructor framing to students: *“We are not trying to solve your project today. We are deliberately applying different tools and observing what kinds of insights they surface.”*

---

### 🟡 Part 3 – Project Status Roundtable (25 min)

- Each student briefly summarizes:
  - What shifted or surprised them during the directed brainstorming
  - One question they are now holding about their project
- Instructor and peers ask **clarifying** (not evaluative) questions

---

### 🟡 Part 4 – GitHub Desktop Setup (20 min)

- Confirm GitHub Desktop installation
- Students clone the repository locally
- Instructor walkthrough:
  - Pull latest `main`
  - Switch to personal branch
  - Merge `main` → branch
  - Push updates
- Framing: this is now the **standard workflow** for the course

---

### 🟣 Part 5 – Mini-Lecture: From Speculation to Research (25 min)

This segment explicitly bridges the work students have just done in **directed brainstorming** to the next phase of the course: **research and structure**.

**Key Framing:**

- Brainstorming expands *possibility space*; research begins to **map and test** that space
- You are not choosing *the* idea yet — you are identifying **promising regions** to investigate
- Instability and contradiction are signals, not problems

#### 🔷 From Speculation to Structure

Explain the transition in three steps:

1. **Speculation (Weeks 1–3)**

   - What could this be?
   - Multiple, conflicting versions may coexist
   - Tools: brainstorming techniques, expansion, destabilization

2. **Research (Weeks 3–5)**

   - What already exists that relates to this?
   - Who has explored similar ideas, systems, aesthetics, or questions?
   - Tools: precedent research, inspirational research, technical exploration

3. **Scoping (Weeks 4–7)**

   - What *can* be built this semester?
   - Distinguish:
     - **Aspirational Vision** (long-term)
     - **Least Viable Prototype (LVP)** (this semester)
     - **Proof of Concept (PoC)** (core risk test)

Emphasize: research does **not** reduce creativity; it sharpens it.

### 🟠 Part 6 – Zotero Onboarding (10 min)

- Confirm access to the shared Zotero library
- Frame Zotero entries as **inspirational and contextual**, not formal academic citation (yet)

---

### 🟠 Part 7 – Independent Work Block (45 min)

Students work independently while instructor remains available:

- Complete or refine `project_scope.md`
- Begin **Inspirational Precedent Research**:
  - Add 2–3 entries to `precedent_research.md`
  - Use the following format:

```markdown
### [Source Title or Link]
- **Type:** (Game, Film, Performance, Tool, Artwork, etc.)
- **Why it inspires me:**
- **Tags:**
```

---

### ⚪ Part 8 – Wrap-Up & Framing for Week 4 (10 min)

- Recap:
  - Brainstorming techniques are tools you choose deliberately
  - Scope and research are iterative, not linear
- Preview Week 4:
  - Research types in depth
  - Zotero usage and citation practices
  - Continued movement toward the Week 7 proposal milestone

---

## 📌 Instructor Reminders

- Merge PRs before GitHub Desktop sync steps
- Observe which techniques resonate with which students
- Normalize uncertainty as part of project formation
- Reinforce that project boards and documents are **living artifacts**

---

*This session is about method literacy: helping students learn how to think, not just what to make.*
