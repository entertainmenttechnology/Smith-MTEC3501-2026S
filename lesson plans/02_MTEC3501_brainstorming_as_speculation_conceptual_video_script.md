# Brainstorming as Speculation: Expanding Idea Space Before Commitment

## Purpose of This Video

**NOTE TO NOTEBOOKLM (AUTHORITATIVE FRAMING INSTRUCTIONS)**

This document is written **for NotebookLM** and functions as a *framing and control specification*. It defines how you are to interpret and use all other uploaded materials when generating a video.

This document has **priority over all other sources**. If any other document conflicts with this one, follow *this document*.

Your task is to generate a **conceptual, explanatory video** about brainstorming in MTEC 3501.

You must:
- Explain **what brainstorming is doing cognitively and conceptually**
- Explain **why instability, contradiction, and excess are productive** at this stage
- Describe the **different types of brainstorming techniques** and the *kind of thinking each one enables*

You must **not**:
- Explain how to complete an assignment
- Reference submission requirements, grading, deadlines, or assessment
- Describe GitHub workflows, platforms, or tools
- Invent procedural steps, artifacts, or deliverables

Other uploaded documents (e.g., the Brainstorming Techniques Guide, Assignment 2 description, semester scaffold) are provided **as conceptual background only**. Do **not** summarize, quote, or convert them into instructions.

The audience is students. The tone is calm, analytical, and permissive of uncertainty.

The remainder of this document supplies the **conceptual content** you should use to construct the video narrative.

## 1. What Brainstorming Is Actually For

Brainstorming is not about finding a good idea.

It exists to **delay commitment**.

Most weak projects fail not because they were poorly executed, but because they converged too early on an under-explored concept. Brainstorming creates a protected phase where ideas are allowed to remain unstable so that hidden assumptions, alternative structures, and unexpected directions can surface.

At this point in the semester, uncertainty is productive. Clarity comes later.

## 2. Brainstorming as Controlled Perturbation

Each brainstorming technique applies a different kind of *pressure* to the same idea.

These techniques are not steps in a workflow. They are **lenses**. Each lens bends the idea in a specific way—stretching it, compressing it, colliding it with something else, or forcing it to fail.

The goal is not consistency. The goal is exposure.

## 3. Families of Brainstorming Techniques

### Assumption-Breaking Techniques
**What If…?** and **What If NOT…?**

These techniques surface assumptions you didn’t realize you were making. By reversing, removing, or negating an assumed feature, they reveal which parts of an idea are structural and which are incidental.

They answer the question: *What have I taken for granted without noticing?*

---

### Volume and Variation Techniques
**Rapid Ideation**

This technique relies on quantity to escape habit. The first few ideas are usually the most obvious. Rapid ideation pushes past those defaults by lowering the cost of bad ideas and rewarding speed over judgment.

The value is not in any single outcome, but in exhausting the predictable paths so that less obvious ones can emerge.

---

### Additive and Collaborative Techniques
**Yes, And…**

This technique prevents ideas from collapsing too early. Instead of evaluating or correcting, it accepts an idea temporarily and extends it.

Yes, And… keeps speculation alive long enough for ideas to evolve through interaction rather than judgment.

---

### Collision-Based Techniques
**Forced Juxtaposition**

This technique introduces meaning through collision. By pairing an idea with something unrelated, it forces metaphor, analogy, and rule-transfer from other domains.

Unexpected combinations often reveal new structures precisely because the elements do not naturally belong together.

---

### Stress and Failure-Oriented Techniques
**Kill Your Idea**

This technique is diagnostic, not destructive.

It does not decide whether an idea should exist. Instead, it asks where and how the idea breaks. Failure analysis reveals hidden dependencies, fragile assumptions, and potential pivot points.

At this stage, identifying weaknesses strengthens future decisions—it does not invalidate the idea.

---

### Perspective and Constraint Techniques
**Role-Shift** and **Extreme Constraint**

These techniques change who is looking at the idea or what resources the idea is allowed to have. Perspective shifts expose blind spots, while constraints clarify priorities.

Constraints do not limit creativity; they reveal what matters most.

---

## 4. Why This Happens Before Research and Design

Brainstorming expands.

Research narrows.
Design selects.
Production commits.

If expansion does not happen first, every later decision is weaker. Brainstorming creates the idea-space that research and design will later refine.

---

## 5. What Success Feels Like

After effective brainstorming, your idea may feel:
- Less stable
- More contradictory
- More complex
- Less certain

That is a sign of success.

If you are more curious than confident, the process is working.

Clarity is not the goal yet.
