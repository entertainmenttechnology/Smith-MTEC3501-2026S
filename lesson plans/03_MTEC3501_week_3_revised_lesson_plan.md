# Week 3 – Lesson Plan (Revised)

**Course:** MTEC 3501 – Culmination Project Development  
**Format:** Zoom (Full Class)  
**Duration:** 2.5 hours (150 minutes)  
**Theme:** From Speculation to Structure – Directed Brainstorming, Project Scoping, and Research Setup

---

## ✅ Learning Goals
By the end of this session, students will:
- Upload and integrate prior brainstorming materials into the shared GitHub workflow
- Practice multiple **directed brainstorming techniques** as structured tools
- Experience how different ideation methods surface different kinds of insight
- Clarify early project scope (PoC → LVP → Aspirational)
- Begin organizing inspirational precedent research
- Understand expectations leading toward the Week 7 proposal milestone

---

## 🕒 Class Agenda (150 Minutes)

### 🟢 Part 1 – GitHub Web Recap and Upload (20 min)
- Verify each student’s project folder exists in their branch
- Students upload:
  - `brainstorm_variants.md`
  - `kill_my_idea.md`
- Students submit Pull Requests to merge into `main`
- Instructor begins merging PRs during subsequent segments

---

### 🔵 Part 2 – Project Status Roundtable (25 min)
- Each student briefly summarizes:
  - Current project direction
  - One uncertainty or tension
- Instructor and peers ask **clarifying** (not evaluative) questions
- Emphasis: articulation, not resolution

---

### 🟡 Part 3 – GitHub Desktop Setup (20 min)
- Confirm GitHub Desktop installation
- Students clone the repository locally
- Instructor walkthrough:
  - Pull latest `main`
  - Switch to personal branch
  - Merge `main` → branch
  - Push updates
- Framing: this is now the **standard workflow** for the course

---

### 🟣 Part 4 – Mini-Lecture: Brainstorming as Method (15 min)

**Key Framing:**
- Brainstorming is not a personality trait; it is a **set of techniques**
- Different techniques produce different kinds of information
- Earlier work relied on **spontaneous ideation**
- Today’s focus: **directed ideation**

Introduce the idea that structured constraints often *increase* creativity by making thinking visible and transferable.

---

## 🟠 Part 5 – Directed Brainstorming Roundtable (40 min)

**Purpose:**
- Replace open-ended “guided questions” with explicit method rehearsal
- Allow students to *experience* multiple brainstorming techniques
- Build a shared vocabulary around ideation tools

**Structure:**
- One student becomes the focus at a time
- One brainstorming technique is applied per student
- The class participates collectively
- The focused student listens and takes notes only
- No defending, correcting, or narrowing during the exercise

> Instructor framing to students:
> *“We are not trying to solve your project today. We are testing tools and observing what kinds of insights they generate.”*

---

### 🔄 Technique Rotation

Each student is paired with **one technique**. Timing guideline: ~3–4 minutes per student.

#### 1️⃣ What If… (Speculative Expansion)
**Prompts:**
- What if this project had to exist in a different medium?
- What if it were designed for the opposite audience?
- What if current technology did not exist?

**Good for:** reopening imaginative space; surfacing ambition

---

#### 2️⃣ Rapid Ideation (Quantity First)
**Prompt:**
- Generate as many variations as possible in 2 minutes
- No discussion or evaluation

**Good for:** breaking fixation; revealing idea clusters

---

#### 3️⃣ Yes, And… (Additive Growth)
**Rule:**
- Every response must begin with “Yes, and…”

**Good for:** collaborative momentum; extensibility

---

#### 4️⃣ Opposite Thinking (Assumption Reversal)
**Prompt:**
- Identify a core assumption and invert it

**Good for:** exposing hidden constraints

---

#### 5️⃣ Forced Juxtaposition
**Prompt:**
- Combine the project with two unrelated concepts provided by the instructor

**Good for:** interdisciplinary connections; novelty

---

#### 6️⃣ Kill Your Idea (Stress Test)
**Prompt:**
- Why would this fail in a semester?
- What makes it unrealistic right now?

**Good for:** scope clarity; PoC vs. LVP distinction

---

#### 7️⃣ Future-Proofing
**Prompt:**
- If this project were revisited in five years, what would change?

**Good for:** strategic thinking; separating timeless vs. contingent elements

---

#### 8️⃣ Mind’s-Eye Visualization
**Prompt:**
- Describe one moment where the project works perfectly
- Focus on experience, not implementation

**Good for:** intent clarity; experiential goals

---

### 🧠 Instructor Notes During Roundtable
- Keep time tight
- Redirect away from problem-solving
- Periodically name what the technique is surfacing (scope, experience, feasibility, etc.)

---

### 🟠 Part 6 – Zotero Onboarding (10 min)
- Confirm access to the shared Zotero library
- Frame Zotero entries as **inspirational and contextual**, not formal academic citation (yet)

---

### 🟠 Part 7 – Independent Work Block (45 min)
Students work independently while instructor remains available:

- Complete or refine `project_scope.md`
- Begin **Inspirational Precedent Research**:
  - Add 2–3 entries to `precedent_research.md`
  - Use the following format:

```markdown
### [Source Title or Link]
- **Type:** (Game, Film, Performance, Tool, Artwork, etc.)
- **Why it inspires me:**
- **Tags:**
```

---

### ⚪ Part 8 – Wrap-Up & Framing for Week 4 (10 min)

- Recap:
  - Brainstorming techniques are tools you choose deliberately
  - Scope and research are iterative, not linear
- Preview Week 4:
  - Research types in depth
  - Zotero usage and citation practices
  - Continued movement toward the Week 7 proposal milestone

---

## 📌 Instructor Reminders
- Merge PRs before GitHub Desktop sync steps
- Observe which techniques resonate with which students
- Normalize uncertainty as part of project formation
- Reinforce that project boards and documents are **living artifacts**

---

*This session is about method literacy: helping students learn how to think, not just what to make.*
