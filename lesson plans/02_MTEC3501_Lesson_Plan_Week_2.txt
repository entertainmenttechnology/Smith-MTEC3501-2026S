## **0. Systems & Environment Setup (Foundational)**

✅ **Goal:** Ensure all students have access to and understand the role of each required platform.

### **Platforms Introduced:**
- **GitHub** – Version control, project artifacts, issues, project boards
- **Zotero** – Reference management for inspirational and precedent research
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Local editing environment (Markdown, code, documentation)
- **Discord** – Class communication, coordination, quick questions (not submissions)
- **Google Drive** – Shared working documents (brainstorms, drafts, in-progress writing)

### **Key Distinctions to Emphasize:**
- Google Docs → thinking in progress
- GitHub → versioned project artifacts
- Zotero → sources and references
- VS Code → local workspace
- Discord → communication and coordination

Students verify access, installations, and logins. Troubleshooting as needed.

---

## **1. GitHub Personal Project Management Setup**
✅ **Skills Introduced:** Branching, folder structure, uploading content, using Pull Requests.

### **Activities:**
- Create a branch: `[your-name]-branch`
- Create folder: `/projects/[your-name]/`
- Upload `project_idea.md` (from last week’s speculative assignment)
- Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`

---

## **2. Brainstorming Techniques (Conceptual Overview)**

Before beginning the in‑class and GitHub‑based brainstorms, briefly introduce the *types* of brainstorming students will be using. The goal is not mastery, but awareness that brainstorming can take multiple forms.

**Techniques introduced:**
- **What If…?** – speculative prompts that deliberately stretch an idea beyond its initial assumptions.
- **Yes, And…** – additive, collaborative expansion that accepts an idea and extends it.
- **What If NOT…?** – removing or negating a core assumption to expose hidden dependencies.
- **Forced Juxtaposition** – combining the project with an unrelated domain, constraint, or medium.
- **Role-Shift Brainstorming** – re-imagining the project from a different stakeholder’s perspective (user, critic, antagonist, system, environment).
- **Extreme Constraint** – asking how the project changes under severe limits (time, scale, sensory modality, resources).
- **Critical Stress Testing (“Kill Your Idea”)** – surfacing weaknesses, contradictions, or failure modes early.

Students are encouraged to treat these techniques as *tools*, not rules. They may combine, remix, or invent variations as needed.

**Optional reference for students:**
- IDEO, *Brainstorming Rules*
- Stanford d.school, *Design Thinking Bootleg*

## **3. Brainstorming Activities (In-Class → GitHub)**

✅ **Skills Introduced:** Multiple brainstorming techniques; transition from live ideation to structured, versioned brainstorming in GitHub.

### **Part 1: In‑Class Brainstorm (Round‑Robin “What If…?”)**

**Format:** Live, synchronous, whole‑class activity (spoken discussion + Google Doc notes)

**Setup:**
- Each student briefly presents the **current scope of their project idea** (1–2 minutes).
- Presentations are based on the **speculative writing assignment** completed for Week 1.
- Students should focus on *what the project is*, *what domain it sits in*, and *what they believe the core idea is right now* — not on polish or feasibility.

**Round‑Robin Brainstorm:**
After each short presentation, the class engages in a rapid **round‑robin “What if…?” brainstorm** focused on that project.

- Classmates offer speculative prompts starting with **“What if…”**
- Prompts should intentionally:
  - stretch or distort the idea
  - challenge assumptions
  - introduce unexpected constraints or opportunities
  - explore alternate audiences, scales, or modalities

**Example (Instructor Model):**
Using *Speculative ELF* as an example:
- *What if* the ELF system could only communicate through indirect signals rather than explicit commands?
- *What if* the ELF misinterpreted intent in productive ways?
- *What if* the system only existed ephemerally and could not be revisited?

**Student Examples:**
- What if this project had to function without visuals?
- What if the primary user was not the intended audience?
- What if this were scaled down to a single interaction?
- What if the system behaved unpredictably on purpose?

**Goals:**
- Expose each project to **multiple external perspectives**
- Demonstrate brainstorming as a **social and iterative process**
- Help students see how quickly an idea can expand, shift, or re‑focus
- Reinforce that early project definitions are **fluid, not fixed**

**Documentation:**
- Each student records key “What if…” prompts and responses directly in their Google Doc tab under a new heading:
  - **In‑Class What If Brainstorm – Week 2**
- No filtering or evaluation is required at this stage; capture ideas as they emerge.


---

### **Part 2: GitHub-Based Brainstorming**

**Format:** Asynchronous-friendly, structured brainstorming using GitHub tools.

**Techniques:**
- **Rapid Ideation** → GitHub Issues
  - Each student creates an issue capturing one refined or transformed idea from the in-class brainstorm.
- **"Yes, And…" Expansion** → Comments on Issues
  - Students comment on at least one peer’s issue, extending or reframing the idea.
- **Forced Juxtaposition** → GitHub Discussions
  - Students introduce unexpected elements (themes, technologies, constraints) and explore new connections.
- **Kill Your Idea Test** → Markdown file + Pull Request
  - Students intentionally critique their own idea to identify weaknesses and possible pivots.
- **Mind Map Synthesis** → Miro mind map → GitHub Wiki
  - Visual integration of insights from all brainstorming activities.

## **4. Asynchronous Brainstorming (Post‑Class)**

Following the in‑class session, students will continue speculative expansion asynchronously using GitHub.

### **GitHub Discussion Board Setup**
- A **Discussion Board** will be enabled in the class repository.
- Each student creates **one discussion thread** titled:
  - `What If – [Your Name / Project Title]`

### **Student Responsibilities (Over the Next Week):**
- Post a short description of your current project idea
- Include 3–5 initial speculative prompts ("What if…") based on in‑class discussion
- Comment substantively on **every other student’s thread** with:
  - bold or unexpected ideas
  - reframings, constraints, or alternate interpretations

**Guidelines:**
- Be generous, curious, and playful
- Avoid feasibility filtering at this stage
- Aim to *expand the possibility space*, not close it

This asynchronous phase allows ideas to mature over time and ensures every project benefits from collective intelligence.

---

## **5. Wrap‑Up: From Personal Ideas to Shared Exploration**

### **In‑Class Reflection:**
- How did your idea change when others engaged with it?
- Which prompts felt most productive or surprising?
- What directions are you curious to explore further?

### **Looking Ahead:**
- Week 3 will introduce **precedent research** and **Zotero** as formal tools
- Students will begin distinguishing **inspiration** from **precedent**
- Speculative ideas generated this week will feed directly into research and scoping next week

---

## **6. Assignment for Next Week**

- Participate fully in the GitHub Discussion Board brainstorm
- Respond to every peer’s discussion thread
- Refine your personal project notes based on group input
- No Zotero or precedent research deliverables are due yet

The emphasis remains on **expansion, not narrowing**.
