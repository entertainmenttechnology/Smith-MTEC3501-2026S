## Course Overview

MTEC 3501 prepares you for your culmination project in the BTech program. You will progress through Research → Design → Production Planning → Assessment, with emphasis on proposal development, precedent research, milestone planning, and juried presentations.

---

## Project Management

We use GitHub Projects (Kanban/Roadmap), Issues, and Milestones for task tracking.

- Individual Projects: maintain a personal board in your `Projects/YourName` folder.
- Group Projects: use the Class Kanban Board for shared tasks.

Peer feedback is tracked via issue comments and the `Proposal_Feedback.yml` template.

## Assignments & Deliverables

Assignments are released weekly and tied to the syllabus.

Key deliverables include:

- Proposal Package (issue + markdown)
- Precedent Research (2–3 pages + Zotero entry)
- Milestone & Timeline (GitHub Projects/Roadmap)
- Juried Presentations (checkpoints and final)
- Proof-of-Concept Prototype (early demo)
- Post-Presentation Analysis (reflection + adjustments)

## AI Collaboration Reporting

All major deliverables require a short AI-use report: prompts, tools, and a brief reflection on AI's influence.
