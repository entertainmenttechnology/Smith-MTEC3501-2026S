# Week 1 — Onboarding: GitHub Username & Access

Purpose
-------
This short onboarding task ensures every student has a GitHub account/username that meets course requirements so we can grant repository access and track work by branch.

Required action (this week)
---------------------------
Create a GitHub account (or confirm your existing account) with a username that meets the course specification below. Submit your GitHub handle by opening a new issue in this repository titled:

"Username: LastName, FirstName — @your-github-handle"

Username specification (must follow)
----------------------------------
- Your GitHub username must clearly identify you. It must include your LAST NAME and at least the initial of your FIRST NAME.
- Use only lowercase letters and hyphens. No spaces, special characters (except `-`), or unusual punctuation.
- Preferred formats (examples):
  - `smith-david`
  - `nguyen-a`
  - `johnson-maria`
- If your preferred handle is already taken, add a single digit suffix, e.g. `smith-david2`.
- Do NOT use handles that obscure your identity (no emoji-only handles, nicknames only, or handles that are likely to confuse instructors/peers).

Why this matters
-----------------
- Clear, consistent usernames let instructors add repository write access and find student branches easily.
- Using a canonical format helps automated grading, roster linking, and archiving at semester end.

How to complete the task
------------------------
1. Sign up or sign in to GitHub: https://github.com/join
2. Confirm your username meets the specification above. Change it if needed in `Settings → Account` on GitHub.
3. Open an issue in this repository titled exactly: `Username: LastName, FirstName — @your-github-handle` and include your full name, student ID (if required), and the email tied to the GitHub account.

Deadline
--------
Complete this task by the end of Week 1 (see course calendar). Instructors will confirm repository access the following week.

Support
-------
If you need help choosing or changing a username, contact the instructor at the email in the course `README.md`, or open an issue titled `Help: GitHub username` and the staff will assist.

Notes
-----
- This is the only required setup for Week 1. Later weeks will ask you to install GitHub Desktop / VS Code and to create your branch and initial project folder.
- If you already use an institutional GitHub account (e.g., GitHub Classroom or campus-managed), that account is acceptable provided it meets the username spec.
