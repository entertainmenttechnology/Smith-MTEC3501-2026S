# Brainstorming Techniques: A Practical Guide

This document describes a range of brainstorming techniques used in MTEC 3501. These techniques are not rules or steps to be followed in order. Instead, think of them as **tools for thinking**. Each one opens a different way of exploring, questioning, or reshaping an idea.

You will encounter these techniques both in class and asynchronously through GitHub activities. Over time, you will likely discover that some techniques work better for you than others, and that combining techniques often leads to the most interesting results.

Throughout this document, a single **example project** is used for means of illustration only:

> **Example project (for illustration only):** *Clamorous E.L.F.* — a speculative interactive environment that responds to sound, presence, and human interaction, evolving through collective participation.

This example is not a model to copy. It is used to demonstrate how different brainstorming techniques act on the *same* idea in different ways.

## How These Techniques Will Be Used in Class and Online

We began with **What If…?** brainstorming as an in-class activity. This technique serves as the entry point for speculation by intentionally stretching assumptions and opening conceptual space.

After this initial activity, the remaining techniques are used to further expand ideas.

**Expectations:**
- Each student will apply **all** of the techniques below to **their own project**.
- For each technique, aim to generate **as many ideas as possible**.
- Seek ideas that feel **chaotic, exaggerated, strange, or impractical**.
- Do *not* judge, refine, or select ideas yet.
- Each student will also contribute **at least two substantive comments** to *every other student’s project* in the GitHub Discussion Board, explicitly using different techniques.

The goal of this phase is **maximum idea generation**. Quantity, range, and boldness matter more than feasibility.

## 1. “What If…?” (Speculative Expansion)

This technique begins by deliberately questioning the assumptions that are quietly embedded in an idea. Students are asked to identify what they are taking for granted—about technology, users, behavior, scale, or context—and then challenge those assumptions directly. The purpose is not to find a better answer, but to reveal how much of the idea is shaped by unexamined expectations.

**What it is:**  
A technique that stretches an idea by questioning or overturning its assumptions.

**Why it is useful:**  
It prevents ideas from becoming fixed too early and exposes hidden assumptions.

**Generic prompts:**
- What assumptions am I making?
- What happens if an assumption is reversed?
- What rules am I taking for granted?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- What if the system behaved unpredictably?
- What if the intended audience were completely different?
- What if this idea existed in a different cultural or technological context?

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* misinterpreted sound rather than responding accurately?
- What if participation caused the system to become less responsive instead of more?

## 2. Rapid Ideation (Divergent Brainstorming)

Rapid ideation focuses on producing a large number of ideas in a short amount of time, without pausing to evaluate quality or feasibility. By prioritizing speed and volume, students bypass habitual or “safe” solutions and allow less obvious possibilities to surface. The value of this technique lies in accumulation rather than refinement.  

**What it is:**  
Generating many ideas quickly without judgment.

**Why it is useful:**  
It pushes thinking beyond obvious solutions and surfaces ideas that only appear through volume.

**Generic prompts:**
- How many versions of this idea can I generate?
- What variations exist?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Generate 10 radically different versions of the project.
- List variations across media, scale, or interaction.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- List ten different environments where *Clamorous E.L.F.* could exist.
  - A subway platform where sound accumulation affects train arrival announcements
  - A forest clearing where wind and wildlife trigger subtle sonic responses
  - An abandoned factory activated only by human movement
  - A multiplayer online space where presence is inferred, not explicit
  - A museum hallway that reacts differently depending on crowd density
  - A school cafeteria during lunch hours only
  - A remote desert installation powered intermittently by solar availability
  - A hospital waiting room with suppressed audio responses
  - A VR-only environment with no physical analog
  - A temporary pop-up structure that exists for one night
- Generate multiple interaction models in rapid succession.

## 3. “Yes, And…” (Additive Collaboration)

This approach requires participants to accept an idea as valid in its current form before adding anything new to it. Rather than correcting, improving, or redirecting an idea, students build directly on what already exists. This keeps the conversation generative and prevents early judgment from shutting down creative momentum.  

**What it is:**  
A collaborative technique that accepts an idea before extending it.

**Why it is useful:**  
It maintains momentum and encourages constructive collaboration.

**Generic prompts:**
- How can this idea be extended?
- What can be added without evaluation?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Yes, and what if it also…
- Yes, and this could connect to…

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- Yes, and what if *Clamorous E.L.F.* allowed participants to influence each other indirectly?
- Yes, and the system could archive traces of prior interactions.

## 4. Forced Juxtaposition (Conceptual Collision)

Forced juxtaposition intentionally brings together the project and an unrelated concept, system, or domain. By placing two things side by side that do not normally belong together, students are prompted to think metaphorically and structurally rather than literally. The insight comes from negotiating the tension between mismatched ideas.

**What it is:**  
Introducing novelty by combining an idea with something unrelated.

**Why it is useful:**  
Unexpected collisions generate insight through contrast and metaphor.

**Generic prompts:**
- What happens when unrelated systems collide?
- What rules from another domain could apply here?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Pair the project with an unrelated domain or concept.
- Use a random word(s) to force an unexpected connection.

You may use a random word generator for this activity:
- [randomwordgenerator.com](https://randomwordgenerator.com/)  

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* operated like a marketplace instead of an artwork?
- What if a randomly generated word (e.g., “migration”) shaped its behavior?

## 5. “Kill Your Idea” (Critical Stress Testing)

In this technique, students intentionally search for ways their idea **would break**—functionally, experientially, or structurally. Instead of defending the concept, the idea is treated as fragile and vulnerable to real-world pressures such as ambiguity, misuse, technical instability, or disengagement. The goal is not to repair the idea, but to expose hidden dependencies and clarify which parts of the concept are assumptions rather than necessities.

**Note:** This technique is the conceptual opposite of **“Yes, And…”**. In *Yes, And…*, we assume the idea is good and worth extending. In *Kill Your Idea*, we assume the idea is bad, naïve, or broken—and we try to prove it.

**What it is:**  
Systematically attacking an idea by asserting specific conditions under which it would fail.

**Why it is useful:**  
Failure analysis reveals unproven assumptions, design opacity, experiential weaknesses, and development risks that must be addressed before an idea can move forward.

**Generic prompts (use assertive language):**
- This would break if ____________________.
- This depends on __________________ being true.
- This fails unless __________________ is explicit or proven.

**Types of breakage to consider:**
- **Functional break:** the system cannot operate, be demonstrated, or tested.
- **Experiential (aesthetic) break:** the system works, but the experience is boring, confusing, unpleasant, or disengaging.
- **Design / interpretive break:** behavior exists, but meaning, intent, or affordances are unclear.
- **Development / proof break:** the idea cannot survive real development constraints or incremental prototyping.

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Identify functional, experiential, design, and development failure points.
- Assume hostile, indifferent, chaotic, or non-ideal conditions.
- Treat unclear behavior, missing proof, or fragile execution as fatal flaws.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- This would break if participants cannot perceive a clear relationship between action and system response.
- This would break if the experience becomes boring or irritating within the first minute.
- This would break if meaningful interaction requires explanation or instruction.
- This would break if sensor noise overwhelms intentional input.
- This would break if core behaviors cannot be prototyped or tested incrementally.

## 6. What If NOT…? (Subtractive Speculation)

Subtractive speculation asks students to remove a component they believe is essential and then examine what remains. By taking something away—an interface, a control mechanism, or a form of feedback—students can see which elements actually define the project. This often exposes simpler or more fundamental versions of the idea.  

**What it is:**  
Exploring an idea by removing something essential.

**Why it is useful:**  
Subtraction clarifies what truly matters.

**Generic prompts:**
- What is essential?
- What remains if something is removed?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Remove interface, control, or feedback.
- Negate a core feature.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* had no visible output?
- What if participants could not intentionally interact?

---

## 7. Role-Shift Brainstorming (Perspective Change)

In this technique, students deliberately reinterpret their project from the position of a different role or stakeholder. Instead of designing from their own intent, they temporarily adopt another perspective and treat that viewpoint as authoritative for the duration of the exercise. The goal is not to fix problems, but to expose blind spots, mismatches, and assumptions that only appear when the designer’s perspective is removed.

**What it is:**  
Reframing an idea by adopting a different role and analyzing the project entirely from that position.

**Why it is useful:**  
Perspective shifts reveal hidden assumptions about users, systems, power, access, interpretation, and responsibility that are often invisible from the designer’s point of view.

**How to use it:**  
Choose **one role** from **one category** below. Do not switch roles mid-pass.

---

### Core Role Categories and Examples

**Participant / User Roles**  
• First-time participant  
• Repeat or long-term participant  
• Confused, distracted, or unwilling participant  

**System & Non-Human Roles**  
• The system as a whole  
• A single sensor or data stream  
• An autonomous or AI-controlled component  

**Designer & Production Roles**  
• Original designer  
• Developer or implementer  
• Maintainer inheriting the project later  

**Critical & Adversarial Roles**  
• Skeptical audience member  
• Disinterested observer  
• Institutional gatekeeper (curator, juror, funder)  

**Contextual & Environmental Roles**  
• The space hosting the work  
• The surrounding public or environment  
• The project running unattended  

**Ethical & Social Roles**  
• Someone excluded by the design  
• Someone negatively impacted by the system  
• Cultural outsider encountering the work  

---

**Technique-specific prompts:**  
- How does the project appear from this role’s position?  
- What assumptions does this role immediately expose?  
- What aspects of the project become unclear, frustrating, or irrelevant?

---

**Examples using *Clamorous E.L.F.* (Multiple Roles)**

- **First-time participant:** The experience provides no clear indication that interaction is possible. Without prior context, it is unclear whether changes in the environment are responses or coincidences, exposing an assumption that users will intuitively understand how to engage.

- **Repeat participant:** After several interactions, patterns become predictable and novelty diminishes. This reveals an assumption that variation alone sustains engagement over time.

- **The system as a whole:** All input arrives as ambiguous signal. Intent, meaning, and participation are inferred externally, not known internally, exposing the assumption that responsiveness implies understanding.

- **Developer / implementer:** Core behaviors rely on tightly coupled components and ideal conditions. Small changes in input quality or timing significantly alter output, revealing an assumption of technical stability that may not hold in deployment.

- **Skeptical audience member:** The experience feels arbitrary rather than intentional. Without a visible logic or payoff, the system appears decorative rather than meaningful, exposing an assumption that interactivity alone creates value.

- **The surrounding environment:** Ambient noise, crowd density, and unrelated activity continuously influence system behavior. This reveals an assumption that the project can be isolated from its context.

*Reminder:* In Role-Shift Brainstorming, you are not repairing the idea. You are documenting how the project changes when authority and interpretation are shifted away from the designer.

## 8. Extreme Constraint (Compression)

In this technique, students deliberately impose severe, artificial constraints on an idea in order to force focus and prioritization. By restricting time, scale, resources, or sensory channels, the project is compressed until only its most essential behaviors can survive. The goal is not realism, but clarity.

**What it is:**  
Reducing an idea by applying strict limits that eliminate optional features and expose what is truly necessary.

**Why it is useful:**  
Constraints reveal priorities, prevent overbuilding, and help distinguish core behaviors from decorative or secondary elements.

**Generic prompts:**  
- What remains when most resources are removed?  
- What absolutely cannot be cut?  
- What does the project become at its smallest possible scale?

**Technique-specific prompts:**  
- Limit duration, scale, or repetition.  
- Restrict the project to a single sensory modality.  
- Remove interactivity, persistence, or complexity.

**Examples using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**  
- What happens if *Clamorous E.L.F.* exists for only 30 seconds and then permanently shuts down?  
- What happens if *Clamorous E.L.F.* operates using sound alone, with no visual feedback?  
- What happens if the system responds only once per participant?  
- What happens if the system must function with a single sensor and no redundancy?

---

*Reminder:* Extreme Constraint is not about making the project smaller forever. It is about discovering which elements are essential before scale and complexity are reintroduced.

---

## Key Reminder

At this stage, you are not deciding what your project is. You are expanding the space of what it *could be*. Expect ideas to shift, fragment, recombine, or contradict themselves. That instability is intentional.
