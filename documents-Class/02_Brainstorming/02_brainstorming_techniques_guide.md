# Brainstorming Techniques: A Practical Guide

This document describes a range of brainstorming techniques used in MTEC 3501. These techniques are not rules or steps to be followed in order. Instead, think of them as **tools for thinking**. Each one opens a different way of exploring, questioning, or reshaping an idea.

You will encounter these techniques both in class and asynchronously through GitHub activities. Over time, you will likely discover that some techniques work better for you than others, and that combining techniques often leads to the most interesting results.

Throughout this document, a single **example project** is used for means of illustration only:

> **Example project (for illustration only):** *Clamorous E.L.F.* — a speculative interactive environment that responds to sound, presence, and human interaction, evolving through collective participation.

This example is not a model to copy. It is used to demonstrate how different brainstorming techniques act on the *same* idea in different ways.

## How These Techniques Will Be Used in Class and Online

We began with **What If…?** brainstorming as an in-class activity. This technique serves as the entry point for speculation by intentionally stretching assumptions and opening conceptual space.

After this initial activity, the remaining techniques are used to further expand ideas.

**Expectations:**
- Each student will apply **all** of the techniques below to **their own project**.
- For each technique, aim to generate **as many ideas as possible**.
- Seek ideas that feel **chaotic, exaggerated, strange, or impractical**.
- Do *not* judge, refine, or select ideas yet.
- Each student will also contribute **at least two substantive comments** to *every other student’s project* in the GitHub Discussion Board, explicitly using different techniques.

The goal of this phase is **maximum idea generation**. Quantity, range, and boldness matter more than feasibility.

## 1. “What If…?” (Speculative Expansion)

**What it is:**  
A technique that stretches an idea by questioning or overturning its assumptions.

**Why it is useful:**  
It prevents ideas from becoming fixed too early and exposes hidden assumptions.

**Generic prompts:**
- What assumptions am I making?
- What happens if an assumption is reversed?
- What rules am I taking for granted?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- What if the system behaved unpredictably?
- What if the intended audience were completely different?
- What if this idea existed in a different cultural or technological context?

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* misinterpreted sound rather than responding accurately?
- What if participation caused the system to become less responsive instead of more?

---

## 2. Rapid Ideation (Divergent Brainstorming)

**What it is:**  
Generating many ideas quickly without judgment.

**Why it is useful:**  
It pushes thinking beyond obvious solutions and surfaces ideas that only appear through volume.

**Generic prompts:**
- How many versions of this idea can I generate?
- What variations exist?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Generate 10 radically different versions of the project.
- List variations across media, scale, or interaction.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- List ten different environments where *Clamorous E.L.F.* could exist.
- Generate multiple interaction models in rapid succession.

## 3. “Yes, And…” (Additive Collaboration)

**What it is:**  
A collaborative technique that accepts an idea before extending it.

**Why it is useful:**  
It maintains momentum and encourages constructive collaboration.

**Generic prompts:**
- How can this idea be extended?
- What can be added without evaluation?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Yes, and what if it also…
- Yes, and this could connect to…

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- Yes, and what if *Clamorous E.L.F.* allowed participants to influence each other indirectly?
- Yes, and the system could archive traces of prior interactions.

## 4. Forced Juxtaposition (Conceptual Collision)

**What it is:**  
Introducing novelty by combining an idea with something unrelated.

**Why it is useful:**  
Unexpected collisions generate insight through contrast and metaphor.

**Generic prompts:**
- What happens when unrelated systems collide?
- What rules from another domain could apply here?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Pair the project with an unrelated domain or concept.
- Use a random word to force an unexpected connection.

You may use a random word generator for this activity:
- https://randomwordgenerator.com/

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* operated like a marketplace instead of an artwork?
- What if a randomly generated word (e.g., “migration”) shaped its behavior?

---

## 5. “Kill Your Idea” (Critical Stress Testing)

**What it is:**  
Challenging an idea by identifying how it might fail.

**Why it is useful:**  
Failure analysis reveals structure, assumptions, and possible pivots.

**Generic prompts:**
- Why would this fail?
- What assumptions must hold for it to work?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Identify technical, conceptual, or experiential failure points.
- Imagine hostile or adverse conditions.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* becomes overwhelming or inaccessible?
- What breaks if participation is minimal or chaotic?

---

## 6. What If NOT…? (Subtractive Speculation)

**What it is:**  
Exploring an idea by removing something essential.

**Why it is useful:**  
Subtraction clarifies what truly matters.

**Generic prompts:**
- What is essential?
- What remains if something is removed?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Remove interface, control, or feedback.
- Negate a core feature.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* had no visible output?
- What if participants could not intentionally interact?

---

## 7. Role-Shift Brainstorming (Perspective Change)

**What it is:**  
Reimagining an idea from a different role or stakeholder.

**Why it is useful:**  
Perspective shifts reveal blind spots and alternative interpretations.

**Generic prompts:**
- Who else is involved?
- How does this look from another position?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Adopt the role of critic, user, system, or adversary.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- How would a skeptical audience member experience *Clamorous E.L.F.*?
- What does the system “think” it is doing?

---

## 8. Extreme Constraint (Compression)

**What it is:**  
Imposing artificial limits to force focus.

**Why it is useful:**  
Constraints reveal priorities and prevent overbuilding.

**Generic prompts:**
- What happens under severe limits?
- What must remain?

**Technique-specific prompts:**
- Limit time, scale, or sensory modality.

**Example using *Clamorous E.L.F.*:**
- What if *Clamorous E.L.F.* existed for only 30 seconds?
- What if it relied on sound alone?

## Key Reminder

At this stage, you are not deciding what your project is. You are expanding the space of what it *could be*. Expect ideas to shift, fragment, recombine, or contradict themselves. That instability is intentional.
