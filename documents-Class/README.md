# documents-Class – Course Support Materials

This folder contains **faculty and student support materials** organized by week. Course content, lesson plans, templates, guides, and instructional resources are organized in numbered subfolders corresponding to each class week.

## Folder Organization

Subfolders are named with a **numeric prefix indicating the week number**, followed by the topic name. For example:
- `01_Introduction/` — Week 1 materials
- `02_Brainstorming/` — Week 2 materials
- `03_ProjectTracking/` — Week 3 materials

This folder also contains core course documents such as the syllabus, research frameworks, and planning guides.

## Important Distinction: Support vs. Assignments

**documents-Class/** contains **teaching materials and support resources** — these guide students through concepts, provide templates, and offer frameworks.

**assignments/** contains **explicit assignment specifications** — these define what students must deliver, deadlines, and evaluation criteria.

Students should reference the assignment folder for concrete deliverables and due dates, and the documents-Class folder for conceptual guidance and instructional support.
