Speculative Reflection (Version 1\)  
Gabriel Aguilar

1. Title & Concept Name – Give your idea a working name.  
   1. Running Man  
2. Speculative Premise – What future, system, or experience are you imagining?  
   1. I imagine a performance that integrates some form of visualization for code, whether that be [p5.js](http://p5.js) or an HTML-based web platform. It will also have to involve some basic networking in order for people to be able to connect their phones to a website.   
3. Core Idea (in plain words) – What is at the heart of your project?  
   1. The Idea of the performance is that one person stands on a treadmill in the center of a room. The audience members will connect their phones to a website displayed at the front of the room. The audience will get a code and a screen that will display either green or red. If the audience member has a red screen, they must convince the actor at the treadmill to input their code. If they do the treadmill gains a bit of speed or incline.  
4. Metaphor or Narrative – A story, image, or analogy that frames your idea.  
   1. I wanted to make a performance about managing expectations and the weight of helping others. It is meant to evoke anger at the performer if they are not able to input your code due to physical limitations.  
5. Speculative Qualities – What makes it bold, emergent, or disruptive?  
   1. I think that the performance highlights a weight we all feel. It shows the hard work that goes into helping others, and the dangers of self-martyrdom.  
6. Personal Connection – How does it connect to your experiences, knowledge, passions, or inspirations?  
   1. I feel a lot of weight back home with my family in Pennsylvania, but I also have a life here in the city and a responsibility to grow here. This piece highlights the tension that the two parts of my life deal with.  
7. User Experience (UX) & Modality  
   1. I think that the user experience for the performance is live. I want them to be able to smell the sweat of the performer as they are performing physically. But I also want to integrate some technology into the performance to show its applications within experimental theatrical settings. The User wll utilize their phone as a tool within the performance.  
8. What is the modality (gameplay, music, performance, installation, robot, etc.)?  
   1. Performance  
9. What does the participant actually do?  
   1. The participant reads a code displayed on their screen and either runs up to or shouts their code at the performer to get them to input it. (Maybe it's not a treadmill, it's a weight, and they are forced to carry the burden if they get out)  
10. What does the experience feel like from their perspective?  
    1. I want the experience to feel frantic, upsetting, and alarming for much of it. But begin in a neutral, uninformed state and end in a reflective state.  
11. Team Potential (optional) – Could this project be collaborative? If so, what roles might others play?  
    1. I think this project could absolutely be collaborative. There are plenty of opportunities for ENT majors to get involved with lighting or sound. ANd Ill need help with the coding.  
       1. Roles include Sound Designer, Lighting Designer, Software Engineer, Network Engineer, Creative Techologist  
12. Challenges & Unknowns – What parts feel difficult, unresolved, or uncertain? What questions remain open?  
    1. I think the biggest hurdles with the project are the visuals on the screen, the performance venue, and the networking required to make a live website that runs the show.  
13. Long Arc Potential – If it developed over years or decades, what could it become?  
    1. I dont necessarily think the piece has long legs in terms of other applications. But I do think it could be a great touring experimental piece in smaller theaters and venues.
