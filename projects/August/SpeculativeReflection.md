1. **Title & Concept Name** – Give your idea a working name.

###The Enigma Machine 

2. **Speculative Premise** – What future, system, or experience are you imagining?  

I could see this project as an interactive installation. Each person could type something out and see the machine work to encode each letter.   
   
3. **Core Idea (in plain words)** – What is at the heart of your project?

This project is a recreation of the Enigma Machine created and decoded during WWII. I want to recreate the Enigma 1 using modern manufacturing processes but with mostly mechanical and simple electrical parts.

4. **Metaphor or Narrative** – A story, image, or analogy that frames your idea.  


5. **Speculative Qualities** – What makes it bold, emergent, or disruptive?  
   The enigma machine in modern times creates an interesting message. It was designed to be an unbreakable encoding device that is very flawed compared to modern technology. It shows that everything is breakable.   
6. **Personal Connection** – How does it connect to your experiences, knowledge, passions, or inspirations?  

7. **User Experience (UX) & Modality**

   To use the enigma machine the user will press a key on the keyboard. This will cause a series of parts to move, rotating the rotors and eventually lighting up an encoded letter on the display. 

8. **Challenges & Unknowns** – What parts feel difficult, unresolved, or uncertain? What questions remain open?  

The main challenges I see are the overall complexity of moving parts and electronics. Many of the parts will have to be resigned multiple times to make the mechanisms work.  
 
9. **Long Arc Potential** – If it developed over years or decades, what could it become?

I think there are a few ways this project could go if more time was spent on it:

* Accuracy, I could choose to focus on recreating a version of the enigma machine as accurately as possible.

* Features, I could choose to focus on adding more modern features to the enigma machine moving away from the original with modern technology.

* Complexity, I could choose to focus on increasing the complexity of the enigma machine through the use of extra rotors and other mechanisms.
