# MTEC 3501 – Assignment
## Week 5: Research Consolidation + Specificity + Miracle Questions

---

## Purpose

You have already verified basic Zotero setup and upload functionality.
This week, the goal is to consolidate the core work from recent assignments into one integrated checkpoint:

- organize your existing research (from Assignment 3) in Zotero,
- refine your Make It Specific document,
- identify and articulate your miracle questions / unknowns.

Together, these will support proposal writing, milestone planning, and March 17 presentation preparation.

---

## Assignment

Complete all three parts below.

For definitions and examples of each required area, see:

- [Week 5 Supporting Document: Research Areas, Specificity, and Miracle Questions](05_document_research_specificity_miracle.md)

### Part 1 — Zotero Research Consolidation

Using the research you started in **Assignment 3**, add and organize your references in your personal Zotero sub-collection.

Your Zotero collection must include references from all three categories:

1. **Precedent Research**
2. **Inspirational Research**
3. **Technical Research**

### Part 2 — Make It Specific Refinement

Revise your **Make It Specific** document so it is clear, concrete, and internally consistent.

Your revision should confirm or update:

1. Working title
2. Format / technology
3. One-sentence project description
4. User / integrator experience
5. System description
6. Explicit dependency

Remove vague placeholders and ensure your project can be understood by someone outside your team.

**Clarification: What “Explicit Dependency” means**

An explicit dependency is the critical condition your project relies on to function as intended.
If this condition fails, the core experience breaks down.

Good dependency examples:

- "This depends on low-latency input response so users can perceive real-time cause and effect."
- "This depends on reliable tracking in low light so gesture interaction remains usable."
- "This depends on stable API access so generated outputs can be produced during use."

Weak (too vague) dependency examples:

- "This depends on users liking it."
- "This depends on good technology."
- "This depends on everything working."

### Part 3 — Miracle Questions / Unknowns

Identify the key "miracle steps" in your project: places where major assumptions, gaps, or unresolved questions still exist.

List unknowns across at least these dimensions:

1. **Technical unknowns** (tools, implementation, performance, integration)
2. **Design / UX unknowns** (interaction clarity, user flow, usability)
3. **Narrative / content unknowns** (meaning, coherence, communication)

For each unknown, include one brief note on how you might investigate or test it.

## Requirements

For this week, each student must:

1. Upload and organize Assignment 3 references in Zotero under precedent, inspirational, and technical categories.
2. Continue adding sources that strengthen both project direction and implementation planning.
3. Refine the Make It Specific document so scope, system, and experience are explicit.
4. Produce a list of miracle questions / unknowns with initial investigation directions.
5. Keep all materials in your personal branch/workflow so they are ready for upcoming review.

---

## Deliverable

By next class, submit/provide all of the following:

### A. Zotero Collection (required)

Your Zotero sub-collection should show a clearly organized set of references across:

- precedent
- inspirational
- technical

This organized collection will be used as source material for:

- your written proposal development
- your bibliography
- your March 17 presentation preparation

### B. Make It Specific Revision (required)

A revised Make It Specific document with no placeholders and clear operational language.

### C. Miracle Questions List (required)

A concise list of key unknowns (technical, design/UX, narrative/content), each paired with a proposed test, research step, or next action.

## Reminder

This assignment is not about inventing a brand-new direction.
It is about making your existing direction research-ready, build-ready, and critique-ready.
