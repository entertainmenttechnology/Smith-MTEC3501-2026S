# MTEC 3501 – Supporting Document
## Week 5: Research Areas, Specificity, and Miracle Questions

---

## Why this guide exists

This guide clarifies the three required areas in Week 5:

1. Zotero research consolidation
2. Make It Specific refinement
3. Miracle Questions / Unknowns

Use this as a reference while completing the assignment.

## 1) Zotero Research Consolidation

Your Zotero sub-collection should include references in three categories.

### A. Precedent Research
Precedent research focuses on projects, works, or systems that are structurally related to what you are building.

Use precedent sources to answer:

- How have similar problems been approached before?
- What design/system patterns are reusable?
- What limitations or failures should I avoid?

Typical sources:

- similar games/tools/installations
- case studies
- published project breakdowns
- documented production workflows

### B. Inspirational Research
Inspirational research focuses on aesthetic, conceptual, emotional, or experiential influences.

Use inspirational sources to answer:

- What kind of mood, meaning, or tone am I trying to create?
- What references shape the feel of this project?
- What should be translated into my project, and what should not?

Typical sources:

- films, music, visual art, performances
- style references
- personal influence references
- mood and form examples

### C. Technical Research
Technical research focuses on feasibility and implementation.

Use technical sources to answer:

- What tools or frameworks are viable?
- What integration or performance constraints exist?
- What methods are proven for this type of build?

Typical sources:

- API/framework documentation
- tutorials with implementation depth
- benchmark/performance references
- hardware/software compatibility notes

### Zotero quality checkpoint
Before submission, verify:

- entries are organized so categories are obvious
- references are project-relevant (not generic filler)
- source metadata is usable for citation/bibliography
- collection reflects both concept direction and build feasibility

## 2) Make It Specific Refinement

Your Make It Specific document should make the project understandable and buildable.

Required structure:

1. Working title
2. Format / technology
3. One-sentence project description
4. User / integrator experience
5. System description
6. Explicit dependency

### What each section should do

**Working title**
- Identifies the project clearly.
- Can be provisional, but should be specific enough to refer to in feedback and planning.

**Format / technology**
- States what kind of project this is (installation, game, tool, etc.).
- Names core technologies/platforms.

**One-sentence description**
- Defines what the project is and what it does.
- Should be concrete, not abstract branding language.

**User / integrator experience**
- Describes what the user does and perceives.
- Explains intended experience and interaction flow.

**System description**
- Describes how the system operates (inputs, processing, outputs, required components).
- Should be operational, not conceptual only.

**Explicit dependency**
- Names the critical condition the project relies on to function as intended.
- If this condition fails, the core experience breaks down.

Good dependency examples:

- "Depends on low-latency input response for perceivable cause-and-effect interaction."
- "Depends on reliable low-light tracking to maintain interaction continuity."
- "Depends on stable API availability to generate outputs during use."

Weak dependency examples:

- "Depends on users liking it."
- "Depends on good technology."
- "Depends on everything working."

## 3) Miracle Questions / Unknowns

Miracle questions identify hidden assumptions in your proposal.

A miracle question is a place where your plan currently says, in effect, "and then this somehow works."

You must identify unknowns in at least three dimensions:

1. Technical unknowns
2. Design / UX unknowns
3. Narrative / content unknowns

### How to write a strong unknown
Use this structure:

- Unknown:
- Why it matters:
- First test/research step:

Example:

- Unknown: Can real-time gesture tracking remain stable in dim light?
- Why it matters: Interaction fails if tracking drops.
- First test/research step: Build a lighting test with two camera setups and compare tracking reliability.

### Quality checkpoint for miracle questions
Before submission, verify each item:

- names a specific uncertainty (not a broad worry)
- explains project impact
- proposes one concrete next action

## Suggested submission bundle for Week 5

Provide:

1. Updated Zotero sub-collection (precedent, inspirational, technical)
2. Revised Make It Specific document
3. Miracle Questions list with initial test/research actions

These three pieces should align with each other and support your next milestone planning steps.
