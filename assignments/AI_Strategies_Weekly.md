## Key Principles for AI Collaboration

1. **Always document AI assistance**: What tool, what prompt, what output, what you changed
2. **Verify AI outputs**: Never trust AI completely, especially for facts, citations, or code
3. **Maintain authorship**: AI assists but you author; maintain your voice and vision
4. **Learn from AI**: Don't just use AI outputs, understand them and learn the underlying concepts
5. **Critical evaluation**: Assess when AI helps vs. when it hinders
6. **Ethical use**: Cite AI assistance appropriately, don't misrepresent AI work as solely yours
7. **Iteration**: AI outputs are starting points, not finished products
8. **Context awareness**: Understand AI limitations and biases in your domain

*This progression ensures students develop sophisticated, critical, and ethical AI collaboration practices that enhance rather than replace human creativity, judgment, and expertise.*
