# MTEC 3501 – Assignment 2
**Week 2 Assignment – Due Week 3**

## Speculative Brainstorming Expansion (Individual + Peer)

### Purpose
This assignment extends the in-class speculative brainstorming work into a structured but intentionally expansive exploration phase. The goal is **not** to decide what your project will be, but to dramatically increase the number of possible directions it *could* take.

You will apply a set of distinct brainstorming techniques to your own project idea and to the ideas of your classmates, using GitHub Discussions as the shared workspace.

At this stage, **quantity, range, and boldness** matter more than feasibility, polish, or correctness.

---

## Part 1: Apply All Brainstorming Techniques to *Your Own Project*

Using the **Brainstorming Techniques Guide**, apply **every technique** to your current project idea.

- You should generate **multiple ideas per technique**
- Do not filter or judge ideas yet
- Wild, contradictory, impractical, or speculative ideas are encouraged

### Where to work
- Navigate to the **existing class Discussion thread** that has already been created for this assignment.
- You will create a **single top-level comment** in that thread that contains your project idea and your full brainstorming expansion.

**Your comment should begin with:**
```
[Your Name] – Project Brainstorming Expansion
```

- Organize the rest of your comment using headings for each technique:

```markdown
## Project Snapshot (Current Proposal)
(2–5 sentences: what you think the project is right now, and why you chose it)

## What If…?
## Rapid Ideation
## Yes, And…
## Forced Juxtaposition
## Kill Your Idea
## What If NOT…?
## Role-Shift
## Extreme Constraint
```

You may use bullet lists, short paragraphs, sketches, links, or embedded media.

## Part 2: Peer Brainstorming (Required)

For **each other student’s project**, you must contribute **at least two substantial comments**, each using a *different brainstorming technique*.

- Explicitly name the technique you are using in your comment
- Focus on expanding, reframing, or destabilizing the idea — not evaluating it

### Example comment structure
```markdown
**Technique Used:** Forced Juxtaposition

What if this project were treated like a ritual instead of a tool?
How would the pacing, repetition, or symbolism change?
```

---

## Expectations and Ground Rules

- You must use **all techniques** on your own project
- You must engage **every other student’s project**
- This is not critique or refinement yet
- Do not worry about feasibility, scope, or tools at this stage
- More ideas = better outcome

---

## What This Prepares You For

This speculative expansion will directly feed into:
- Project scoping
- Precedent and inspirational research
- Proof-of-concept decisions
- GitHub project tracking and issue creation

You are building *idea space* now so that later decisions are informed, intentional, and well-supported.

**Reminder:**
If your idea feels chaotic or unstable after this assignment, that means it is working.
