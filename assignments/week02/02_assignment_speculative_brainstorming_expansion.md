# MTEC 3501 – Assignment 2
**Week 2 Assignment – Due Week 3**

## Speculative Brainstorming Expansion (Individual + Peer)

### Purpose
This assignment extends the in-class speculative brainstorming work into a structured but intentionally expansive exploration phase. The goal is **not** to decide what your project will be, but to dramatically increase the number of possible directions it *could* take.

You will apply a set of distinct brainstorming techniques to your own project idea and to the ideas of your classmates, using GitHub Discussions as the shared workspace.

At this stage, **quantity, range, and boldness** matter more than feasibility, polish, or correctness.

## Setup: Establish Your Discussion Board Presence & Create Your Working Document

**Before you begin brainstorming, complete these two steps:**

### 1. Create a Discussion Board Comment (Your Hub)

Navigate to the **GitHub Discussions** board for this assignment. In the Discussion Board _Welcome to Brainstorm 1!_, Create a **top-level comment** that introduces your project. Begin with:

```
[Your Name] – Brainstorming for [Project Title]
```

Include a brief **Project Snapshot** (2–5 sentences describing what you think your project is right now, and why you chose it).

You may also include links to relevant materials, such as:
- Your GitHub branch (specify the branch name clearly, e.g., "working on `feature/main-concept` branch")
- Google Drive or Dropbox links to proposal documents
- Sketches, images, or inspiration links

This comment becomes your hub. Other students will respond to this comment with peer feedback and brainstorming suggestions.

### 2. Create Your Own Working Document

Create a document called **"Brainstorming_1_[YourName]"** (e.g., "Brainstorming_1_Smith_David") and work wherever you are most comfortable — this can be a Google Doc, Markdown file, notebook, or any format that suits your thinking process. 

(This is version 1, as there may be additional iterations later. Eventually, this document will be uploaded to your GitHub project folder for archival.)

## Part 1: Apply All Brainstorming Techniques to Your Own Project

Using the **[Brainstorming Techniques Guide](../../documents-Class/02_Brainstorming/02_brainstorming_techniques_guide.md)**, apply **every technique** to your current project idea in your own working document.

- You should generate **multiple ideas per technique**
- Do not filter or judge ideas yet
- Wild, contradictory, impractical, or speculative ideas are encouraged

### Organize Your Brainstorming

Use headings for each technique:

```markdown
## What If…?
## Rapid Ideation
## Yes, And…
## Forced Juxtaposition
## Kill Your Idea
## What If NOT…?
## Role-Shift
## Extreme Constraint
```

You may use bullet lists, short paragraphs, sketches, links, or embedded media.

**Important:** Complete Part 1 fully before moving to Part 2. Your own exploration must be complete before you support your peers.

---

## Part 2: Peer Brainstorming (Required)

Once you have completed Part 1, you are ready to support your classmates.

For **each other student's brainstorming comment** in the Discussion Board, you must contribute **at least two substantial replies**, each using a *different brainstorming technique*.

- Explicitly name the technique you are using in your reply
- Focus on expanding, reframing, or destabilizing the idea — not evaluating it
- Your replies should build on what the student has already shared in their initial proposal

### Example reply structure
```markdown
**Technique Used:** Forced Juxtaposition

What if this project were treated like a ritual instead of a tool?
How would the pacing, repetition, or symbolism change?
```

---

## Expectations and Ground Rules

- You must use **all techniques** on your own project in Part 1
- You must engage **every other student's project** in Part 2
- Complete your own work (Setup + Part 1) before providing peer feedback (Part 2)
- Do not share your internal brainstorming document yet — focus on the peer feedback process
- This is not critique or refinement yet
- Do not worry about feasibility, scope, or tools at this stage
- More ideas = better outcome

---

## What This Prepares You For

This speculative expansion will directly feed into:
- Project scoping
- Precedent and inspirational research
- Proof-of-concept decisions
- GitHub project tracking and issue creation

You are building *idea space* now so that later decisions are informed, intentional, and well-supported.

**Reminder:**
If your idea feels chaotic or unstable after this assignment, that means it is working.
