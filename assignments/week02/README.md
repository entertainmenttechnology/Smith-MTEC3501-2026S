This week, you will continue to refine your proposal, based on the "Whatif" scenarios we explored in class.  
A link to that Google document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxAizZq-tNI_USFXjVMqMC8Gy4u8zthl_NxuTtiQ_Vw/edit?usp=sharing).  

If you were not in class, you can add to this document: create a new tab with your name, and then provide information for your proposal.  

You also need to generate a new branch with named with your name, create your GitHub projects folder and place your speculation into your folder.  

You will then also put your updated proposal information into the Discussion Board of that name (See the discussions on the GitHub main tab, or you can get there from [this link](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-2026S/discussions/1).  
Each member of the class will then provide a variety of different brainstorm responses to the other proposals.
