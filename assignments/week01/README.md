**Platforms & Applications Setup**

All students must establish accounts on four collaboration platforms and install three desktop applications by the end of Week 1:

**Platforms to Register:**
- **GitHub** – Repository for project materials and version control (username must include last name and first initial)
- **Zotero** – Collaborative reference management for research
- **Discord** – Real-time team communication and announcements
- **Google** – File sharing and collaboration via Google Drive

**Applications to Install:**
- **GitHub Desktop** – Local repository management
- **Zotero Desktop** – Local reference management and syncing
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Text editor and IDE for code and file editing

Once you've completed all registrations and installations, submit an **Onboarding Report** via GitHub issue with all your user IDs and confirmation of installed applications. Instructors will verify setup and grant repository access the following week.

**First Project Spark**

Your first assignment is a written or multimedia reflection on a long-term project idea. Draw from your own experiences, passions, and inspirations—no outside research at this point!  Use only your internal memory, ideas, and thoughts. Speculate boldly without budget or time constraints, but keep your idea grounded in physical possibility. The reflection should articulate your idea's **User Experience (UX)**, making it clear what participants will *do* and what the experience will *feel like*. Also surface any perceived difficulties or unanswered questions you anticipate. This becomes your **speculative seed** for subsequent iterations: it will develop into a detailed proposal, design documents, and potentially a prototype in future semesters. Submit a shareable document (Google Doc, PDF, or equivalent) by Week 2 and be ready to present your idea orally (2–3 minutes) during the brainstorming session, emphasizing modality, user experience, and open questions.
