# Week 1 — Onboarding: Platforms & Applications Setup

## Purpose
This onboarding task ensures every student establishes accounts and installs applications required for course collaboration, version control, research management, and communication. You will register with five platforms and install three desktop applications.

---

## Required Actions (Week 1)

Complete all five platform registrations and three application installations by the end of Week 1. You will then submit a single onboarding report with all your user IDs and credentials.

---

## Platform Registrations

### 1. GitHub
**Purpose:** Repository for project materials, version control, and collaborative coding.

**Actions:**
1. Create an account or confirm your existing account: https://github.com/join
2. Choose a username that meets the specification below
3. **Upload a custom profile picture** to your GitHub account. [Learn how to personalize your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/tutorials/personalize-your-profile). Using a distinctive profile picture across platforms aids in visual identification and makes collaboration easier.
4. Download and install **GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com/

**GitHub Username Specification (must follow):**
- Your GitHub username must clearly identify you. It must include your LAST NAME and at least the initial of your FIRST NAME.
- Use only lowercase letters and hyphens. No spaces, special characters (except `-`), or unusual punctuation.
- Preferred formats (examples):
  - `smith-david`
  - `nguyen-a`
  - `johnson-maria`
- If your preferred handle is already taken, add a single digit suffix, e.g. `smith-david2`.
- Do NOT use handles that obscure your identity (no emoji-only handles, nicknames only, or handles that are likely to confuse instructors/peers).

**Why this matters:**
- Clear, consistent usernames let instructors add repository write access and find student branches easily.
- Using a canonical format helps automated grading, roster linking, and archiving at semester end.

### 2. Zotero
**Purpose:** Collaborative reference management and citation sharing for research.

**Actions:**
1. Create an account on Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/user/register
2. Download and install **Zotero Desktop**: https://www.zotero.org/download/
3. Configure your desktop app to sync with your online Zotero account
4. The course admin team will send an invitation to your registered Zotero email to join the shared group library. Accept it once received.

**Zotero Username Specification:**
- Use a clear, professional username.
- Examples: "smith-david_research" or "smith-d_2026"
- If possible, duplicate the same name as you used for GitHub.

### 3. Discord
**Purpose:** Real-time communication, announcements, and informal discussions.

**Actions:**
1. Create a new Discord account with your real name (or use an existing account): https://discord.com/register
2. Once you've registered your GitHub and Zotero accounts, the course admin will provide a server invitation link.
3. Join the course Discord server using the invitation link (note: links expire, so join promptly).
4. **If you are using an existing Discord account with an anonymous or generic username:** Set your **server nickname** for the MTEC 3501 server to clearly identify you by your real name. [Learn how to set a server nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames).
5. Enable notifications for critical channels.

**Discord Username Specification (for MTEC 3501 server):**
- You may use an existing Discord account, but your **server nickname for MTEC 3501 must include your real name** as a clear identifier.
- Examples: "smith-david" or "david-smith-mtec3501" or "David Smith"
- This ensures instructors and classmates can easily identify you on the course server.

### 4. Google
**Purpose:** File sharing, collaboration via Google Drive, and meeting scheduling through Google Calendar.

**Actions:**
1. Create or confirm you have a Google account: https://accounts.google.com/signup
2. Use a professional email address (institutional email or a professional Gmail account).
3. Ensure you have access to Google Drive for collaborative documents.

**Google Account Specification:**
- Use a professional email address.
- Examples: "david.smith@citytech.cuny.edu" or "david.smith.research@gmail.com"

## Application Installations (Desktop)

Install the following three applications on your computer:

1. **GitHub Desktop**  
   Download: https://desktop.github.com/  
   This allows you to manage repositories, commit code, and push changes from your local machine.

2. **Zotero Desktop**  
   Download: https://www.zotero.org/download/  
   This syncs with your online Zotero account and allows you to manage research citations locally.

3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
   Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/  
   This is the text editor and IDE used for code and file editing throughout the course.

- Contact the instructor at the email in the course `README.md`
- Open an issue titled `Help: Onboarding Setup` and the staff will assist you

## Notes

- **Professionalism:** All usernames must clearly identify you. Avoid vague or informal names that could create confusion.
- **Multiple Steps:** Some platforms may require email verification or additional configuration. Complete all steps in each registration process.
- **Desktop Applications:** These are essential for Week 2 onward. Ensure all three are installed and functional before the next class session.
- **Shared Libraries:** After your GitHub account is added to the CHI-CityTech organization, you will receive access to shared repositories. After you accept the Zotero group library invitation, you will have access to shared research references.
