# 📂 MTEC 3501 – Assignments

This folder contains weekly assignments for **MTEC 3501: Culmination Project Development**.  
Assignments are sequenced according to the **S–R–D–M–P–A cycle**:  
Speculate → Research → Design → Make → Publish → Assess.  

Each week builds toward your **end-of-semester prototype (Proof of Concept)** and prepares you for your Culmination Project (Least Viable Product in the following semester).
