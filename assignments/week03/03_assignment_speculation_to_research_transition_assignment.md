## MTEC 3501 – Speculation to Research Transition Assignment

### Overview
This two‑week assignment bridges the course from **speculation and brainstorming** into **structured research**. You will continue expanding your project ideas using multiple brainstorming techniques, then begin organizing and analyzing those ideas so they can inform the research phase.

At this stage, **quantity and range matter more than quality or feasibility**. You are not selecting a final idea yet. You are building a rich idea field and identifying what you need to learn next.

---

## Part 1 – Continued Brainstorming (Individual + Discussion Board)

### A. Individual Brainstorming (Required)
Continue applying **all brainstorming techniques introduced in class** to your own project.

**Requirements:**
- Use *every* brainstorming technique at least once.
- Collect **all ideas**, including trivial, strange, contradictory, or impractical ones.
- Do **not** edit, refine, or judge ideas at this stage.
- The more ideas you generate, the better.

**Deliverable:**
- A single document (bullet list or grouped lists are fine) containing **all brainstormed ideas**.
- Clearly label sections by brainstorming technique.

---

### B. Discussion Board Participation (Required)
You must actively contribute to your peers’ idea development.

**Requirements:**
- Respond to **every other student’s project proposal** in the discussion board.
- Each response must:
  - Add a *new* idea or perspective
  - Clearly state **which brainstorming technique** you are using

**Example comment format:**
> *Technique: Role‑Shift (Skeptical Audience)*  
> From this perspective, the project might feel arbitrary unless…

This phase emphasizes **collaborative expansion**, not critique.

## Part 2 – Idea Collection & Preliminary Evaluation

Once brainstorming is complete, review your full list of ideas.

**What to do:**
- Read through *everything* you generated.
- Identify patterns, clusters, or recurring questions.
- Note ideas that:
  - Reveal strong interests
  - Expose assumptions
  - Suggest clear research needs

You are **not choosing a final concept**. You are identifying **directions worth investigating**.

**Deliverable:**
- A short reflective section added to your brainstorm document addressing:
  - What themes or questions emerged?
  - What surprised you?
  - What feels unclear or under‑researched?

---

## Part 3 – Zotero Setup (Required)

Research work in this course will be managed using **Zotero**.

**Requirements:**
- Create a Zotero account.
- Install Zotero (desktop + browser connector).
- Join the course Zotero group library (link provided in class).

**Deliverable:**
- Confirmation of Zotero setup (screenshot or brief note in your document).

---

## Part 4 – Inspirational Research (Initial Phase)

Inspirational research is **speculative and reflective**. This is *not* research you go out to do—it emerges from influences you already know.

**What to do:**
- Identify several inspirational references related to your project.
- These may include artworks, games, installations, music, films, personal experiences, or aesthetic influences.

**Important:**
- Inspiration is allowed to be subjective.
- Analysis of inspiration must be explicit.

**For each inspirational reference, address:**
- What specifically resonates (form, behavior, mood, structure)?
- What kind of experience or problem does this reference address?
- What assumptions does it reveal about your interests?
- What should translate into your project—and what should not?

**Deliverable:**
- A clearly labeled **Inspirational Research** section in your document.

---

## Timeline

This is a **two‑week assignment**.

- **Week 1:** Continue brainstorming + discussion board engagement
- **Week 2:** Organize ideas, set up Zotero, begin inspirational research

We will continue with **precedent, technical, theoretical, and user research** in the following class sessions.

---

## Looking Ahead – Week 7 Presentation Preparation

The work you complete here directly feeds into the **Week 7 project presentations**.

By Week 7, you should be prepared to present:
- Your expanded idea space
- Key themes and questions that emerged from brainstorming
- Initial inspirational references and analysis
- Early indications of research directions

This assignment establishes the foundation for those deliverables.

## Key Reminder

> You are not trying to be right yet.
> You are trying to be thorough.

Depth later depends on range now.
