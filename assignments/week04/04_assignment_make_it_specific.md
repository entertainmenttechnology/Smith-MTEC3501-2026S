# MTEC 3501 – Assignment
## Make It Specific: Transition from Speculation to Research

---

## Purpose

This assignment moves your project from open-ended brainstorming into structural clarity.  
You are not finalizing your idea. You are making it precise enough that research, feasibility testing, and prototype planning can begin.

If your idea cannot be described clearly, it cannot be built.

---

## What You Must Submit

You must complete the **Make It Specific Template** and submit it as a clean, formatted document (PDF or Markdown).

Your submission must include:

1. Student (Team)
2. Working Title
3. Project Format
4. Project Description (one sentence only)
5. User / Integrator Experience (5–7 sentences)
6. System Description (operational, not abstract)
7. Explicit Dependency

Follow the template exactly.

---

## Requirements

Your document must:

- Contain no placeholders
- Avoid vague language ("immersive," "interactive," "engaging" without explanation)
- Clearly distinguish between experience and system
- Identify at least one concrete dependency

**Clarification: What “Explicit Dependency” means**

An explicit dependency is the critical condition your project relies on to function as intended.
If this condition fails, the core experience breaks down.

Good dependency examples:

- "This depends on low-latency input response so users can perceive real-time cause and effect."
- "This depends on reliable tracking in low light so gesture interaction remains usable."
- "This depends on stable API access so generated outputs can be produced during use."

Weak (too vague) dependency examples:

- "This depends on users liking it."
- "This depends on good technology."
- "This depends on everything working."

If the system cannot be understood by someone outside your team, revise it.

## Length Guidelines

Approximate length:
- 1–2 pages
- Clear section headings
- No filler text

Clarity matters more than length.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

- Structural clarity
- Specificity of format
- Coherence between user experience and system
- Operational detail in system description
- Identification of a real dependency
- Readiness for research expansion

If research questions cannot attach naturally to your document, it is not specific enough.

---

## Connection to Upcoming Milestones

This document becomes:

- The foundation for your Zotero research structure
- The basis for precedent and technical research
- The anchor for GitHub issue planning
- The core framing for the March 17 adjudication

You are building the architectural foundation of your project.

## Deadline

Submit by: __________________________

Late or incomplete submissions delay your ability to move into structured research and prototype planning.

---

## Reminder

This is not about having the "best" idea.
It is about having a buildable idea.
