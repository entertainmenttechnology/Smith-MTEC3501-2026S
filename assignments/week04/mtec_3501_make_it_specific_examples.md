# MTEC 3501 – Make It Specific Examples

---

## Title → Format → User Experience → System → Dependency

This document provides structured examples of how to complete the **Make It Specific** exercise. These are models. Your project does not need to look like these — but it must be this clear.

Each example includes:
- Working Title
- Project Format
- **Project Description (one sentence)**
- User / Integrator Experience
- System Description
- Explicit Dependency

# Example 1 – Interactive Installation

**Student (Team):** DavidBStudent (Individual Project)

## Working Title
Clamorous E.L.F.

## Project Format
Interactive Audiovisual Installation (Projection + Spatial Audio)

## Project Description
An interactive installation where participant-generated sound and movement reshape a projection-mapped audiovisual environment in real time.

## User Experience
A participant enters a dimly lit room filled with layered ambient sound and projection-mapped surfaces.  
They are able to generate sound and movement that alters the environment.  
The system responds by transforming those inputs into evolving sonic textures and shifting visual patterns.  
Over time, repeated interactions accumulate and subtly reshape the room’s atmosphere.  
The intended experience is collective authorship and environmental transformation.  
This depends on participants perceiving a clear cause–effect relationship between their actions and system behavior.

## System Description
Microphones and depth cameras capture audio and gesture input.  
Signal processing occurs in Max/MSP or TouchDesigner.  
A mapping engine translates input data into audiovisual transformations.  
Outputs include multi-channel spatial audio and projection-mapped visuals.  
Hardware includes speakers, projector, computing workstation, and sensor array.

# Example 4 – Fabrication / Physical System

**Student (Team):** Sofia Ahmed (Sofia Ahmed & Marcus Doyle)

## Working Title
Adaptive Artifact Lab

## Project Format
Parametric Fabrication System (Web Interface + 3D Printing)

## Project Description
A web-based parametric design system that generates printable 3D artifacts from adjustable geometric parameters.

## User Experience
Users design modular artifacts through a browser-based interface.  
They adjust parameters that influence geometry and structural behavior.  
The system generates printable STL files in real time.  
Over time, iterative fabrication produces evolving object families.  
The intended experience is tangible authorship over generative form.  
This depends on reliable translation between digital model and physical print.

## System Description
Web-based parametric modeling interface built with Three.js.  
Exports STL files for slicing software.  
Uses generative algorithm to adjust geometry constraints.  
FDM 3D printer used for physical production.

# Example 5 – AI-Assisted Creative Tool

**Student (Team):** Ethan Park (Individual Project)

## Working Title
EchoWeave

## Project Format
AI-Assisted Music Composition Platform

## Project Description
An AI-supported composition platform that generates structured musical variations from user-submitted motifs through adjustable stylistic parameters.

## User Experience
A composer uploads a short musical motif.  
They adjust parameters such as mood, density, and instrumentation.  
The system generates structured variations on the motif.  
Over time, iterative refinement produces increasingly distinct stylistic results.  
The intended experience is co-authorship with a computational partner.  
This depends on generated variations remaining recognizable while meaningfully transformed.

## System Description
Web-based interface connected to generative music model API.  
MIDI input processing engine.  
Output includes downloadable MIDI and audio renders.  
Parameter controls influence harmony, rhythm, and orchestration density.

# Structural Reminder

Every project must include:
- Title
- Format
- User (or Integrator)
- System
- Dependency

If any layer is missing, research cannot attach effectively.
